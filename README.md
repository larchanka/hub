Telescope is an open-source, real-time social news site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com)

**Note:** Telescope is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)

### Developing on DigitalOcean

We use `meteor-up` package for easy deployment (mup.json, settings.json)

This video explains the deployment process https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLGdXtZMmiI

**WNB exceptions:**

- we host MongoDB on DO (in the video they use compose.io), 
so in mup.json we do not change `setupMongo` to `false` and do not add `MongoURL`

**Tips:**

- `SSHPass` needs to be installed (on linux) to ssh without prompt
- on linux run `sudo mup deploy` instead of just `mup deploy`
